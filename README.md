# Fetch MediaWiki site configuration

Helper script to properly configure [`parse_wiki_text`](https://docs.rs/parse_wiki_text) for different wikis.

Originally at <https://github.com/portstrom/fetch_mediawiki_configuration> ([Internet Archive snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20200907151105/https://github.com/portstrom/fetch_mediawiki_configuration)), the repo is now deleted, along with all the user's related wiki repos.
The libraries are preserved in various github forks and on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs).
However, no public copies of `fetch_mediawiki_configuration` are available.

This project is a recreation of the functionality of the original script.
Inferences and assumptions made are documented under [Implementation notes](#implementation-notes).

## Usage

Use `cargo run --` followed by the arguments to run the script.
Pass argument `--help` for more information:
```shell
cargo run -- --help
```
